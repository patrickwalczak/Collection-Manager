        My main language was Python for a very long time and I used Flask to
        build websites. But, once I decided that I wanted reactivity on my page,
        I decided diving headfirst into Vuejs. I had no problem assimilating
        myself with JavaScript code. I never really needed to know everything in
        Javascript to code in Vuejs, but when I needed anything, I would just
        look it up.
